WPdo - Simple Make WordPress in Bash
====================================

**Simple command line tool to install WordPress TRUNK and patches from make.wordpress.org**  
<https://make.wordpress.org/>


WHAT IS WPDO
------------

Starting from scratch in contributing to Make WordPress is challenging, expecially for non-developers.
This tool, while still a command line tool, is meant to simplify how people can interact with the technical side of things, from setup to patches.

If you just need support for patches and you're comfortable with Grunt, you might want to check [grunt-patch-wordpress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-patch-wordpress).

WHAT DOES IT DO
---------------

* Helps setting up a Mac OSX dev environment (sorry, just OSX for now, collaborations welcome)
* Helps updating a local WordPress TRUNK setup via SVN
* Helps applying and clearing patches easily


INSTALLATION

Fast:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/folletto/WPdo/master/wpdo -o wpdo.php && php wpdo.php install`
